 write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal that does the following:

1) method that returns the sum of two integers

casual: 
instruct user to input two numbers to be added
take two variables as integers set to variables
Add them together and set them to a varibale 
Call that variable to the user

formal:  

START
GET two numbers from user to add
SET result to the two numbers added together
PRINT result to user
END


2) method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all 
those strings concatenated together

casual:
Given an array, iterate over that array and concatenate each element together 
and saved to another variable. 

formal:
START
GIVEN an array of strings called "words"
SET counter = 0 
SET string_together method
WHILE counter <= number of array values, add each elementt to the SET "sentence"
Return sentence
END

3) method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

casual:
Given an array of integers:
- select odd numbered elements in the array
- add each selected odd element to variable: odd_array  
- return the new odd_array


formal:

START

Given array of integers


SET odd_array to odd numbered selection of elements of given array
Return odd_array

END
